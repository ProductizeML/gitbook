# PM Terminology

## Product Management

* **MVP \(Minimum Viable Product\):** the first launched version of your product to customers. It is developed with a minimum number of features to solve your problem in a simple way. It is generally used as a trial tool only.
* **MLP \(Minimum Lovable Product\):** similar to an MVP, but with special consideration for its design and UI. It aims to solve the problem, but also delight.
* **MMP \(Minimum Marketable Product\):** this is the version of your MVP \(or MLP\) which you will launch to market.
* **Business Impact Analysis** \(BIA\): predicts the consequences of disruptions to a business by collecting data and measuring metrics to develop alternative strategies if our proposed solution fails.
