## Train, Evaluate, and Deploy Models

Once you deploy the first version of your product is when you really start working on it since you will start understanding better your users and their real needs.

## Monitoring and Evaluating your KPIs

Once your product is deployed and users start interacting with it, their insights will guide you through the next optimizations steps. A good way to evaluate the success of these is by defining **KPI \(Key Performance Indicator\)** that are aligned with your [Business Objectives](ml-lifecycle.md#business-objectives) as described above. 



Based on the customer interactions with the product, you will be able to customize the product experience for each customer segment.



During this iterative process, there must be constant communication between all stakeholders, in order for Product Managers to guide the Data Science team toward the most impactful features to include for the business.
