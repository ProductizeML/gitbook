# ML Life Cycle

![](../.gitbook/assets/ml_life_cycle%20%281%29.png)



## Definitions and metrics

We can split our product initial stages as:

* üöÄ **MVP \(Minimum Viable Product\):** the first launched version of your product to customers. It is developed with a minimum number of features to solve your problem in a simple way. It is generally used as a trial tool only.
* ‚ù§Ô∏è **MLP \(Minimum Lovable Product\):** similar to an MVP, but with special consideration for its design and UI. It aims to solve the problem, but also delight users.
* üí∞ **MMP \(Minimum Marketable Product\):** this is the version of your MVP \(or MLP\) which you will launch to market.
