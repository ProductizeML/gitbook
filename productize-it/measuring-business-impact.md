# Measuring Business Impact

**Business Impact Analysis** \(BIA\) tries to predict the consequences of disruptions to a business by collecting data and measuring metrics to develop alternative strategies if our proposed solution fails. For AI solutions, BIA is highly recommended since the risk of integration and customer adoption is usually pretty high.

## Definitions and metrics

We can split our product initial stages as:

* 🚀 **MVP \(Minimum Viable Product\):** the first launched version of your product to customers. It is developed with a minimum number of features to solve your problem in a simple way. It is generally used as a trial tool only.
* ❤️ **MLP \(Minimum Lovable Product\):** similar to an MVP, but with special consideration for its design and UI. It aims to solve the problem, but also delight.
* 💰 **MMP \(Minimum Marketable Product\):** this is the version of your MVP \(or MLP\) which you will launch to market.

## Measure

We can find multiple strategies to measure your machine learning model and product impact over your business, such as reactions from your stakeholders, partners, and employees, Return on Investment \(ROI\), among others, but in this course, we will focus on the well-known _A/B testing_ approach.
