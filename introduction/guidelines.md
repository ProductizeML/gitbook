# Guidelines

The course is organized in **four lectures** that cover the full **life-cycle of an AI & ML product** from the research and formulation of the business idea, how initial and user data is collected, curated, and standardized so it can be fed back to the system, what the tools that are available to train and evaluate your ML models are, followed by best practices to deploy and monitor your model.

Each lecture contains a series of short and practical lessons and recommended readings at the end.

## Tools

This course is taught in an interactive environment that lets learners exchange opinions and thoughts with the instructors and community. In order to achieve that, a really important part of this course does not only live in the content pages exclusively but also in the [Slack Channel ](https://join.slack.com/t/productizeml/shared_invite/zt-g0mp69ty-iK5PeBu5W2vlZBg3QC4D2A)and page comments.

Example of interaction between learners, course, and instructors.
