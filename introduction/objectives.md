# Objectives

## Let your product be _smart_

If you are reading this, you are probably interested in or thinking about building a product that uses some form of Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning. Maybe you want to make predictions from the data you are generating using a trained ML model, or maybe you want to automate existing repetitive and time-consuming tasks with a high-performing AI solution. You might also be thinking about how you can ship these solutions as new products or features for your users so you can provide them value and collect real-world data, and feed it back to your product so it can become better over time.

## Productizing ML solutions

In recent years, large consumer and data-driven companies such as Netflix, Facebook, and  Google have already deployed ML at scale in their production pipeline as [recommendation systems](https://research.google/pubs/pub45530/), targeted ads, and optimized search results. These solutions were enabled by leveraging their massive amount of data and big data tools, but even without these key pieces, any company should be able to ship their first AI product.

## Measuring Business Impact

The course that you are about to start will provide you with guidelines and best practices for the productization of Machine Learning solutions and how businesses can benefit from incorporating AI into their current pipelines.

This is, in fact, a really important point this course focuses on how to measure the business impact and success of your product not only from the technology point of view but also how it is presented to users and these benefits from it.

## ML Product Management

* An AI Product Manager \(PM\) has core product skills \(strategy, road maps, prioritization, etc.\) along with an intuitive grasp of ML.
* They help identify and prioritize the highest value applications for machine learning and do what it takes to make them successful.

## Challenges to solve

Throughout the course, we will learn that once a solution is moved into production, there are some concerns we might face related to data dependencies and changes in the external world, model complexity, reproducibility, testing, monitoring, model deployment, and quick delivery of new models. At the end of this self-study course, you will feel confident on how to build a solution that prevents these setbacks to happen, as well as the best way to tackle these.

## Content

In general terms, this course will provide the learner with:

* Common and most-used **AI**, **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Data Science** terminology;
* What someone can expect **realistically** from these systems to do and what they actually cannot do;
* Abilities to understand what the **opportunities** of an **AI/ML product** are, and how these can impact their institution, organization, or personal project;
* Computational resources and recommended frameworks;
* Best practices on data collection and curation;
* Training, optimization, and monitoring of Machine Learning models;
* Instructions on how to build reproducible machine learning pipelines;
* Create continuous and automated integration to deploy models;
* When building a product, what things we want the AI solution to improve or

  enhance when compared to traditional solutions;

* Recommendations on how to deliver AI/ML-generated predictions to users;
* Understand real-world cases and users data;
* Hands-on exercises and assignments;

## The course

In order to achieve that, this course is online and open-ended regarding the product and technical delivery recommendations. The shared content will get updated periodically in order to guarantee new and state-of-the-art information. 

The community \(you\) will engage with the course in the form of chats and comments, and they will take an important role in the content of the course as well, promoting a shared course built thanks to every learner. This course is quite unique not only to the content that is delivered given its novelty but also regarding the technologies that will be used. 

The estimated course time will be of **8-10 hours**, including course-specific content, recommended readings from other sources like articles and blog posts, and finally a course-specific hands-on experience.

Once again, _**Welcome**_ to this exciting course!
