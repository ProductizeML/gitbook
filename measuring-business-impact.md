# Measuring Business Impact

**Business Impact Analysis** \(BIA\) tries to predict the consequences of disruptions to a business by collecting data and measuring metrics to develop alternative strategies if our proposed solution fails. For AI solutions, BIA is highly recommended since the risk of integration and customer adoption is usually pretty high.

## Definitions and metrics

We can split our product initial stages as:

* üöÄ **MVP \(Minimum Viable Product\):** the first launched version of your product to customers. It is developed with a minimum number of features to solve your problem in a simple way. It is generally used as a trial tool only.
* ‚ù§Ô∏è **MLP \(Minimum Lovable Product\):** similar to an MVP, but with special consideration for its design and UI. It aims to solve the problem, but also delight.
* üí∞ **MMP \(Minimum Marketable Product\):** this is the version of your MVP \(or MLP\) which you will launch to market.

## Measure

We can find multiple strategies to measure your machine learning model and product impact over your business, such as reactions from your stakeholders, partners, and employees, Return on Investment \(ROI\), among others, but in this course, we will focus on the well-known _A/B testing_ approach.

### A/B testing

A/B testing can help to obtain research statistical significance when running two different experiments in order to obtain a better sense of your customers.

And after each iteration, try to answer:

* Did the user visit the next day?
* How long did the user visit the site?
* What were the daily active users?

Along with the study, you should conduct user research questions like:

* Is the user happy using the product?
* Is the user satisfied with the experience?
* Is the product improving the user‚Äôs overall well¬≠being?
* How will this affect the company‚Äôs overall health?

Since most all of these questions are hard measure, Product Managers tend to use proxies in order to assess questions in an open way: if the user is happy with the product, they will stay on the site for a longer time. If the user is satisfied, they will visit again tomorrow.

Another recommended approach when measuring and monitoring your solution in order to satisfy your business continuity requirements when launching an AI solution, is to try to encode business metrics into your loss function in order to evaluate how well your models are doing regarding your business needs.
