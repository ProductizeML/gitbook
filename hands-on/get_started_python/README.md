# Get Started with Python

From [_Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29)_:_

> Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming \(including by metaprogramming __and metaobjects  Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. 
>
> The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python \(PEP 20\), which includes aphorisms such as:
>
> * Beautiful is better than ugly.
> * Explicit is better than implicit.
> * Simple is better than complex.
> * Complex is better than complicated.
> * Readability counts.
>
> Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications.
