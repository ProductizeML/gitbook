# Introduction

A [2018 GitHub study](https://github.blog/2019-01-24-the-state-of-the-octoverse-machine-learning/) looked at contributors to repositories tagged with the “machine-learning” topic, and ranked the most common primary languages of the repositories. Python is the most common language among machine learning repositories and is the second most common language on GitHub overall \(2019\). Python has many awesome visualization packages and useful core libraries like Numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn which really makes your work very easy and empower the machines to learn.   
 

* [**Numpy**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/numpy-in-python-set-1-introduction/)**:** Numeric Python or Numpy is a Linear Algebra Library for Python with powerful data structures for efficient computation of multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
* [**Pandas**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pandas-tutorial/)**:** It is the most popular Python library which provides highly optimized performance for data analysis.
* [**Matplotlib**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-introduction-matplotlib/)**:** It is a popular python plotting library used for creating basic graphs like line charts, bar charts, histograms and many more.
* [**Seaborn**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/seaborn-distribution-plots/)**:** Provides a high-level interface for creating attractive graphs
* **sci-kit Learn:** It is used for data mining and data analysis which implements a wide-range of machine-learning algorithms like classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means .
