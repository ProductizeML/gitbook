# Python Installation

We recommend installing [_**pyenv**_](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) **,** a package that will manage **multiple versions of Python** and is described as "_simple, unobtrusive, and follows the Unix tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well_".

## Installation Guides

* [MacOS](python_macos.md)
* [Linux](python_linux.md)
